# AAMVA PDF417 DATA Reader, written in rust, for Drivers Licenses and Identification Cards
Rust crate for reading ASNI files from a pdf147 barcode.
**Breaking changes may happen without notice until a better design implementation has been created, this is not a stable release.**

## Usage
```
[dependencies]
aamva-rs = { git = "https://github.com/ibotva/aamva-rs", branch = "main" }
```

## Basic Example
> This example uses the `rxing` crate to decode the picture of the pdf147 barcode, and then passes the contents to the ASNI struct.
> Bare in mind, I had to crop the pdf417 code to size and it has to be a good picture of the code.

```rust
use asni_rs::documents::{DriversLicense, Reader};
use rxing::BarcodeFormat::PDF_417;

fn main() {
    match rxing::helpers::detect_in_file("./path_to_img.jpeg", Some(PDF_417)) {
        Ok(res) => {
            match DriversLicense::new(res.to_string()) {
                Ok((header, drivers_license)) => {
                    println!("{:#?}", header);
                    println!("{:#?}", drivers_license);
                },
                Err(err) => println!("Drivers License Error: {}", err),
            }
            
        },
        Err(err) => println!("PDF417 Barcode Error: {}", err),
    };
}

}
```

## AAMVA Standard Docs and Notes
- [AAMVA DL/ID Card Design Standard PDF](https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/99ac7057-0f4d-4461-b0a2-3a5532e1b35c/AAMVA-2020-DLID-Card-Design-Standard.pdf) Pages 46 through 61 define the PDF417 design spec, including an element table starting at 50.

- Data from AAMVA spec cards is encoded in ASCII/iso-8859-1, also known as Latin1. However, because the barcode decoder decodes it to a rust string slice, the encoding for this reader will be UTF-8.

- [Open Source AAMVA JavaScript Client](https://github.com/winfinit/aamvajs/blob/master/index.js), this has loads of useful information about specific versions.
