# AAMVA PDF417 DATA Reader for Drivers Licenses and Identification Cards written in rust
Rust crate for reading ASNI files from a pdf147 barcode.
**Breaking changes may happen without notice until a better design implementation has been created, this is not a stable release.**

## Usage
```
[dependencies]
my-secret-crate = { git = "https://github.com/ibotva/ASNI-rs", branch = "main" }
```

## Basic Example
> This example uses the `rxing` crate to decode the picture of the pdf147 barcode, and then passes the contents to the ASNI struct.

```rust
let file_name = "./img.jpeg";

let results = rxing::helpers::detect_multiple_in_file(file_name).expect("decode error");
    
for result in results {
    let reader = ASNI::from(result.getText().to_string()).unwrap();
    println!("{:#?}", reader);
}
```

## AAMVA Standard Docs and Notes
- [AAMVA DL/ID Card Design Standard PDF](https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/99ac7057-0f4d-4461-b0a2-3a5532e1b35c/AAMVA-2020-DLID-Card-Design-Standard.pdf) Pages 46 through 61 define the PDF417 design spec, including an element table starting at 50.

- Data from AAMVA spec cards is encoded in ASCII/iso-8859-1, also known as Latin1. However, because the barcode decoder decodes it to a rust string slice, the encoding for this reader will be UTF-8.

- [Open Source AAMVA JavaScript Client](https://github.com/winfinit/aamvajs/blob/master/index.js), this has loads of useful information about specific versions.
